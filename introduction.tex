\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the three-dimensional organization of DNA has been shown to 
be a key driver of important processes in molecular biology.
However, even with the most advanced experimental methods like Hi-C, 
it remains comparatively expensive to study the spatial folding of DNA,
so that current knowledge of three-dimensional DNA organization is still sketchy.
In the last five years, several methods have been proposed to improve on this situation
by determining DNA-DNA interactions \emph{in-silico}, using existing experimental data.

However, most current in-silico approaches leave room for improvement, for example with regard to usability, the necessary type and amount of data or the pre- and postprocessing steps required.
The goal of this master thesis is thus to provide an approach for the prediction of Hi-C interaction matrices which is easy to operate and requires only data from \acrshort{cs}
experiments with minimal pre- and postprocessing.
