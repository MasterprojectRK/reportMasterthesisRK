\section{Discussion and Outlook}
Approach by Farre et al also working for human data.
Changes might bring benefits in certain cituations, but are not a big improvement.

cGAN seems promising, but the discriminator remains to improve.
Improvements still not good enough to beat transfer GM12878-K562 in many cases.

Conclusion w.r.t. comparison to other approaches

Learning from mixed up samples, true matrix but non-matching conditional input could improve things,
commonly done in text-to-image synthesis networks.
