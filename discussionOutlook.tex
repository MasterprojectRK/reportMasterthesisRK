\section{Discussion and Outlook}
Approach by Farre et al also working for human data.
Changes might bring benefits in certain cituations, but are not a big improvement.

cGAN seems promising, but the discriminator remains to improve.
Improvements still not good enough to beat transfer GM12878-K562 in many cases.

If possible, compare to other approaches. 
Maybe we can use the one by Zhang et al. for which data from study project exists, but it might take too long.

Learning from mixed up samples, true matrix but non-matching conditional input could improve things,
commonly done in text-to-image synthesis networks.
