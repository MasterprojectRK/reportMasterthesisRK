  comment    = {Authors propose a combination of CNN / DNN to predict interaction counts (Hi-C matrices) from
ChIP-seq data in a two step process.
First step is a convolutional network that converts the ChIP-seq tracks to a single 1D representation.
Second step is a dense network that converts the 1D rep into interaction counts, i. e. Hi-C matrices.
A window approach is followed for training, with a central window and left/right flanking windows of adjustable width (but  a fixed setting of w=80kbp was used in the paper). 

The predicted matrices have a Pearson correlation of 0.6...0.7 and look somewhat mediocre when compared to real matrices.

Additionally, the paper presents the so called backward approach to predict the 1D rep from Hi-C data and then compares the predicted 1D rep with the one derived from ChIP-seq. This is extensively used to draw conclusion on the importance of certain factors on 3D conformation.

The CNN / DNN are quite well described in the paper and are both not really deep, i. e. have relatively few layers. Seems more adapted to running on a personal computer than a computing cluster, also considering a statement in the report that estimates the training time to be around 30min on a notebook computer.

The network can only be trained on (80 x bin_size) submatrices and the predictions of larger matrices must thus be ensembles of multiple overlapping windows. The network this way limits the max. distance inherently to 80x bin size, here 800kbp. Each bin/bin interacting pair in the matrix is represented by one neuron of the final DNN layer (which comprises 80x81\2=3240 neurons). The correspondence Hi-C matrix pair - neuron is not stated, but should be arbitrary, as long as it is not mixed up during training and test phase. It is not clear how boundary handling has been done (left/right sequences do not exist at start/end of chromosomes). The given number of training pairs has not yet been understood. 

At least two of the graphs in the report seem buggy and one is also low resolution.},

Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a \emph{per-pixel} loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing \emph{perceptual} loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.},

  comment    = {Authors propose Rambutan, a deep learning method to predict statistically significant DNA-DNA interactions from DNA sequence and DNase-seq data.
Inputs are one-hot encoded DNA sequence, binary coded log-fold change in DNase-seq over control and binary coded distance with certain resolution (seems bit weird). The target labels for training are interactions called by Fit-Hi-C with certain q-values. Outputs are binary classifications into statistically significant interaction / no interaction.
The idea behind using Fit-Hi-C significant contacts versus real Hi-C data is to avoid e.g. sequencing bias and distance dependency in experimental Hi-C data.

For each potentially interacting pair, Rambutan uses combinations of CNN and max pooling layers and then concatenates the results again in a CNN-max pooling combination. The layers from the two branches of the interacting pair are then joined in a dense neural network, which also considers the binary coded distance. 

Results are ok, but not better than just using the cell line on which Rambutan has been trained
as a predictor for other cell lines. In this regard, the paper also contains a logical error which the
authors noted just before publication. Not yet appeared in a scientific journal in corrected form.},

This is insofar relevant for the thesis, as we try to penalize structural mismatches, which could be done by using a custom loss function based on TAD detection algorithms.
Supplementary material 1 has nice short descriptions how the different algorithms work. 
The tools can be grouped into four general approaches: Binning and linear score, clustering, statistical and graph-based. Most seem too difficult to implement on tensors and/or might take too long to compute. Some also have a large number of parameters, up to 13, making them difficult to tune.
One of the assessment features was concordance with biological features, given here by CTCF and Cohesin subcomponents enrichment. In this regard, and combined with computational efficiency, TopDom, arrowhead and GMAP performed well.
TopDom computes mean interaction frequencies within diamonds and then evaluates minima in the statistics for TAD boundary or not.
Arrowhead uses a special transformation of the Hi-C matrix (should be possible with Tensors, see Rao2014) and then computes three scores on that using DP, taking bins with max. score as boundaries. GMAP is a statistical approach based on a 2-component Gaussian modeling interaction frequencies. It has several parameters.},

However, in image domain especially, the limitation of MSE is obvious: it assumes pixel independence and ignores spatial relationships of samples. This contradicts most architectures of Auto-Encoders which use convolutional layers to extract spatial dependent features. We base on the structural similarity metric (SSIM) and propose a novel level weighted structural similarity (LWSSIM) loss for convolutional Auto-Encoders. Experiments on common datasets on various Auto-Encoder variants show that our loss is able to outperform the MSE loss and the Vanilla SSIM loss. We also provide reasons why our model is able to succeed in cases where the standard SSIM loss fails.},

CNN takes 1hot encoded DNA as input, uses trunk and head networks to predict 2D Hi-C map.
Trunk works on 1D vectors using various layers of convolution filters. Head converts 1D representations to 2D by averaging and including distance information followed by convolutional filters and additionally enforcing symmetry.
Training is on Hi-C matrices from Rao 2014 and Micro-C datasets from Krietstein 2019.
Various measures have been taken to improve learning, including data augmentation and parameter optimization with Dragonfly Bayesian optimization toolkit.

Resolution is fixed at 2048bp and matrices have been cut into about 1Mb chunks for training and prediction.

  comment    = {Authors present a support vector machine (SVM) which learns to classify interacting / non-interacting pairs of DNA sequences from 5C data.
Main focus is on predicting long-range interactions, and based on sequence alone, using the so-called oligomer-distance-histogram representation for DNA to get vectors of the same length for all loci (otherwise not the case for 5C data).
This approach is not intended for full interaction matrix prediction but might be useful in TAD boundary prediction or prediction of 3D structure from Hi-C data etc.
It is shown that 3- and 5-mer repeats are among the driving factors for interactions.
Since the SVM is used as a classifier, only binary output, i.e. interaction / no interaction, however, for training, there is also a third class, none of the two, if there is interaction at certain resolution / in a certain replicate but not in all of them.},

  abstract  = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net},

Meanwhile, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate highly compelling images of specific categories, such as faces, album covers, and room interiors. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GAN formulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image modeling, translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate the capability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers from detailed text descriptions.},

For the MNIST net, Generator and Discriminator are multilayer perceptrons. Discriminator architecture is described as not being too critical, just needs enough power.
The results in this paper were not better than those of best performing specialized nets.

This is the basic reference for cGANs and probably the first description of them},
